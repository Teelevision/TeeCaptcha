TeeCaptcha
==========

TeeCaptcha is a small tool that renders Teeworlds styled captchas.

This tool comes with the MIT license (see file LICENSE).
**All images** used are taken from Teeworlds and come with their own license, see Teeworlds-license.txt.

For help on using the software, call it with --help or -h.

The file TeeCaptcha was compiled on a 64 bit Debian system using gcc, I guess. To run, libpng needs to be installed.
